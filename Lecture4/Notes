HTML BOILERPLATE.


<!Doctype html>
A doctype tells the browser what version of html the page is written in.


<html lang = "en">
    <head></head>
    <body></body>
    </html>
    The <html> tag is the top level element of the html file. You will nest the <head> and <body> tags inside of it.
    The lang attribute inside the opening <html> tag sets the language for the page.


<meta  charset = "UTF-8">
UTF-8 is the standard character encoding you should use in your Web pages. This will usually be the First <meta> tag shown in the <head> element.


<meta name ="viewport" content = "width=device-width, initial-scale = 1.0">
This tag render the width of the page to the width of the devices screen size. Tf you have a mobile device that is 600px wide, the the browser window will also be 600px wide.

Note: I should explor MDN website for know some more tags and their use.
